                <p>Roman Pearce is the childhood friend of Brian 
                    O'Conner and a former convict who harbored stolen 
                    cars. He won his freedom after taking down drug 
                    lord Carter Verone in an undercover assignment by U.S. Customs with Brian in Miami. He then became a member 
                    of Dominic Toretto's crew when Dominic, Mia Toretto and Brian planned to steal money from corrupt Portuguese 
                    businessman, Hernan Reyes.[1] 
                    Roman also became partners with Tej Parker.

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Roman Pearce was born on April 12, 1978 and raised in Barstow, California. As 
                    a child, he befriended another Barstow local, Brian O'Conner. Roman and Brian grew up 
                    together, and often caused trouble together and played sports.[2] Roman and Brian attended
                    high school together, and often dated the same girls, Roman dating the girls Brian was no 
                    longer romantically involved with.[2][note 1] When Roman and Brian attended prom, Roman presumably 
                    had sex with an undesirable girl nicknamed "No Knees" Denise

                <h2>Infiltrating Carter Verone's Empire</h2>
                <p>Following Brian's arrest in Miami by Special Agent Bilkins and U.S. Customs Agent Markham, 
                    Brian agreed to help Bilkins and Markham expose and arrest drug lord, Carter Verone, if he could choose 
                    who would go undercover with him. Bilkins and Brian traveled to Barstow where Roman was making a living a
                    demolition derby driver. When Roman won the derby,
                    he spotted Brian in the stands with Bilkins and headed for his RV.

                <h2>Reconciling with Brian</h2>
                <p>Brian and Roman worked with Tej to lose Bilkins's and Markham's tracking devices on their 
                    Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII and Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. During that time, Roman finally
                    took responsibility for the actions that led to his arrest and reconciled with Brian, who he longer blamed. 
                    Brian admitted that letting Dom go was largely motivated by the guilt he harbored for being unable to help Roman. 
                    With help from Tej, they orchestrated a "scramble", after driving into a garage they later had hundreds of race cars
                    come out, having switched cars with Tej and Suki while in the garage.

                <h2>Aftermath of Carter Verone</h2>
                <p>After the arrest of Verone, Roman and Brian's criminal records were cleared. They each took
                    their share of Verone's money, unbeknownst to Bilkins, and made plans to open a garage in Miami together. 
                    It is unknown what happened to these plans as Brian later joined the FBI, leaving Miami to return to Los Angeles.
                    It's likely that Roman either stayed in Miami, as he said he would, or returned to Barstow

                <h2>Furious 7</h2>
                <p>Roman is first seen at Han's funeral. He wants Brian to promise him they won't be going to any
                     more funerals, to which Brian assures him that the only funeral left where they will be going 
                     will be Deckard Shaw's. Next, Roman is brought by Mr. Nobody to the base as part of Dom's crew.
                      While being briefed, Roman shows his disapproval for the plan made by Mr. Nobody's team to rescue
                       Ramsey, and tells that he's tired of doing things he's told to do, and that he either gets to call 
                       the shots or walks out.
